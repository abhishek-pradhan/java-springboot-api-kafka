# java-springboot-api-kafka

- This API is written in Java Spring Boot (with spring kafka) &amp; has working code for Kafka Producer &amp; Consumer with JSON serializer/deserializer for Kafka message value.
- For now, I am using kafka running on my local, but the code is written to take external kafka servers into account & can easily be configured.
- I will be treating this as a golden api, & my future APIs will be based on this
